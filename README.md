itto
====

itto is a minimalistic linux distribution that runs entirely in RAM and provides a thin layer (middleware) between the device hardware and the user OS. This results in a complete abstraction of the hardware layer and the software layers. This allows the software layer (including the user OS) to become completely independant of the hardware platform it is running on.
